Picture Lab Day 4: 2D Arrays in Java (not complete)
=======================================================

This section should be mostly review and is just here to help you practice your skills traversing 2D arrays. In this section you will be working with integer data stored in a 2D array.
Java actually uses arrays of arrays to represent 2D arrays. This means that each element in the outer array is a reference to another array. The data can be in either row-major or column-major order.
The AP Computer Science A course specification tells you to assume that all 2D arrays are row-major, which means that the outer array in Java represents the rows and the inner arrays represent the columns.

   Here is a method in the ``IntArrayWorker`` class, it operates in a private instance variable
   named ``matrix``. What does this method do?

   .. code-block:: Java

       public int mysteryMethod() {
         int total = 0;
         for (int row = 0; row < matrix.length; row++) {
            for (int col = 0; col < matrix[0].length; col++) {
                total = total + matrix[row][col];
            }
         }
         return total;
       }

   - It sums up all the values in the matrix[0] column

     - matrix[0].length is different from just the matrix column 0, what does matrix[0].length return? How does this affect the inner loop

   - This method sums up all the column and row indexes to find the matrix's 'weight'

     - This is not what the method does and matrix 'weight' does not exist.

   - This method finds the total number of cells are in a given 2D array.

     - The number of cells would be found through multiplying the rows by the columns.

   - This method finds the total of all the values in a 2D array of integers.

     + correct!

   Which of these methods correctly sums up the values in a 2D array? Assume the 2D array is called ``matrix``.

   - .. code-block:: Java

       public int getCount() {
         int total = 0;
         int i = 0;
         int j = 0;
         while (matrix.length != 0) {
            while (matrix[0].length != 0) {
                total += matrix[i][j];
                i++;
                j++;
            }
         }
       }

     - This method doesn't know when to stop so it will continue forever and index out of bounds and this leads to undefined behavior.

   - .. code-block:: Java

       public int getCount() {
         int total = 0;
         for (int[] rowArray : matrix) {
            for (int item : rowArray) {
                total = total + item;
            }
         }
         return total;
       }

     + Correct! This used nested for each loops to iterate through the array.

   - .. code-block:: Java

       public int getCount() {
         int total = 0;
         for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[0].length; j++) {
                total = total + arr[j][i];
            }
         }
         return total;
       }

     + Correct! This adds up the values in each column rather than going row by row.

   - .. code-block:: Java

       public int getCount() {
          int total = 0;
          int mystery = 0;
          int row = 0;
          while (row < matrix.length) {
              for (int col = 0; j < matrix[0].length; i++) {
                  if (row % 2 == 0) {
                      total = total +  matrix[row][col];
                  }
                  else {
                      mystery = mystery + matrix[row][col];
                  }
              }
              row++;
          }
          return (total - mystery);
       }

     - this does not return the correct amount.

    Write a ``getLargest`` method in the ``IntArrayWorker`` class that returns the largest value in the matrix.
    There is already a method to test this in ``IntArrayWorkerTester``. For an extra challenge, try completing the ``fillPattern1`` method.

   What would a functioning implementation of a frequency method, called ``getColTotal``, in the ``IntArrayWorker`` class look like?
   We want this method to accept a target int, and then return how many times that int appears in the array.

   - .. code-block:: Java

       public int getColTotal(int target) {
          int count = 0;
          int current = 0;
             for (int row = 0; row < matrix.length; row++) {
               for(int col = 0; col < matrix[0].length; col++) {
                   current = matrix[row][col];
                   if (current == target) {
               count++;
               }
             }
           }
          return count;
        }

     + Correct! This uses nested for loops and is a very typical solution.

   - .. code-block:: Java

        public int getColTotal(int target) {
        int count = 0;
            for (int item : matrix) {
                if (target == item) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
          return count;
        }

     - This for each loop is not quite enough to iterate through the whole 2D array

   - .. code-block:: Java

        public int getColTotal(int target) {
          int count = 0;
          for (int[] rowArray : matrix) {
             for (int item : rowArray) {
                 total = total + item;
             }
          }
          return count;
        }

     + Correct! this uses nested for each loops to accomplish the task.

   - .. code-block:: Java

        public int getColTotal(int target) {
        int count = 0;
            for (int row = 0; row < matrix.length; row++) {
                if (matrix[row].find(target)) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            return count;
        }

     - find() does not exist in the Java array class, if you're unsure of what is available you can look up the array API.

Alternative ways to store 2D arrays
---------------------------------------------------
Some programming languages use a one-dimensional (1D) array to represent a two-dimensional (2D) array with the data in either row-major or column-major order. Row-major order in a 1D array means that all the data for the first row is stored before the data for the next row in the 1D array.
Column-major order in a 1D array means that all the data for the first column is stored before the data for the next column in the 1D array. The order matters, because you need to calculate the position in the 1D array based on the order, the number of rows and columns, and the current column and row numbers (indices).
The rows and columns are numbered (indexed) and often that numbering starts at 0 as it does in Java. The top left row has an index of 0 and the top left column has an index of 0. This information is helpful when implementing so more complex data structures, but those are out of the scope of this class.
For now, being familiar with this introduction may prove useful in the future.
