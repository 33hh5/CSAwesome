   :answer_d: (x <= 10) || (x > 5)
   :answer_e: (x > 10) || (x <= 5)
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Use A and B to represent the expressions -- A becomes (x > 10), B becomes (x <= 5). ! (A && B) is NOT equivalent to (!A && !B). 
   :feedback_b: Use A and B to represent the expressions -- A becomes (x > 10), B becomes (x <= 5). ! (A && B) is NOT equivalent to (A && B).
   :feedback_c: Use A and B to represent the expressions -- A becomes (x > 10), B becomes (x <= 5). ! (A && B) is NOT equivalent to (!A && !B). The AND should be changed to an OR.
   :feedback_d: Correct! 
   :feedback_e: Use A and B to represent the expressions -- A becomes (x > 10), B becomes (x <= 5). ! (A && B) is NOT equivalent to (A || B). Both A and B should also be negated.

   :answer_d: s="rain"; b=4;
   :answer_e: s="bow";  b=4;
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Strings are immutable so changing str doesn't affect the string that s refers to. Step through the code at https://www.shorturl.at/jkBU2
   :feedback_b: Nothing done in the method test affects the value of b. Step through the code at https://www.shorturl.at/jkBU2

.. mchoice:: mid_1_7
   :answer_a: The getAge method should be declared as private.
   :answer_b: The return type of the getAge method should be void.
   :answer_c: The getAge method should have at least one parameter.
   :answer_d: The variable age is not declared inside the getAge method.
   :answer_e: The instance variable age should be returned instead of a, which is local to the constructor.
   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: The method should be public so it can be accessed outside of the class.
   :feedback_b: The method return type should stay as int.
   :feedback_c: The getAge should not take any parameters.
   :feedback_d: This is an instance variable and should be declared outside.
   :feedback_e: Correct! The accessor method getAge should return the instance variable age.

   Consider the following Cat class, with the cat’s age stored in the method’s int attribute. The getAge method is intended to allow methods in other classes to access a Cat object’s age value; however, it does not work as intended. Which of the following best explains why the getAge method does NOT work as intended?

   .. code-block:: java

      public class Cat{
         private int age;

   :answer_a: I only
   :answer_b: I and II only
   :answer_c: I and III only
   :answer_d: IV
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: It's true that the local variables can be declared in the body of constructors and methods, but II,III are also true about local variables.
   :feedback_b: Static methods cannot call non-static methods, so III is false.
   :feedback_c: Both I and III are true but II is also true regarding local variables.
   :feedback_d: Correct! All of the above are true.

   Which of the following statements are TRUE about local variables?

   .. code-block:: java

      I.   Local variables can be declared in the body of constructors and methods.
      II.  Local variables may only be used within the constructor or method and cannot be 
           declared to be public or private.
      III. When there is a local variable with the same name as an instance variable, the 
           variable name will refer to the local variable instead of the instance variable.
      IV.  All of the above.

.. mchoice:: mid_1_9
   :answer_a: I and II
   :answer_b: V
   :answer_c: I,II and IV
   :answer_d: I and III
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Both I and II are true about static methods, but IV is also true.
   :feedback_b: Static methods cannot call non-static methods, so III is false.
   :feedback_c: Correct! I, II, and IV are true.
   :feedback_d: I is true, but III is not true. Static methods cannot call non-static methods.

   Which of the following statements are TRUE about Static methods?

   .. code-block:: java

      I.   Static methods and variables include the keyword static before their name in the 
           header or declaration. They can be public or private.
      II.  Static methods cannot access or change the values of instance variables, but they
           can access or change the values of static variables.
      III. Static methods can call non-static methods.
      IV.  Static methods are associated with the class, not objects of the class.
      V.   All of the above.

   :answer_b: var1 = 1, var2 = 1
   :answer_c: var1 = 3, var2 = -1
   :answer_d: var1 = 2, var2 = 0
   :answer_e: The loop won't finish executing because of a division by zero.
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This would be true if the body of the while loop never executed. This would have happened if the while check was if var1 != 0 instead of var2 != 0
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the body of the while loop only execued one time, but it executes twice.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if the body of the while loop executed three times, but it executes twice.
   :feedback_d: Correct!
   :feedback_e: 0/2 won't cause a division by zero. The result is just zero.

   What are the values of var1 and var2 after the following code segment is executed and the while loop finishes?

   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: x is initialized (set) to -5 to start and incremented (x++) before the print statement executes. Step through the code at https://www.shorturl.at/dgotA.
   :feedback_b: x is incremented (x++) from -5 before the print statement executes. Step through the code at https://www.shorturl.at/dgotA.

   :answer_d: This code will not print anything.
   :answer_e: 0 3 6 9 12
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This would be true if this loop had the correct syntax on the print.
   :feedback_b: The conditional would only match multiples of three, and the program does not output anything due to incorrect syntax.
   :feedback_c: The conditional would only match multiples of three, and the program does not output anything due to incorrect syntax.
   :feedback_d: Correct! The syntax to output text is System.out.print(), so this code will cause a compiler error.
   :feedback_e: The program does not output anything due to incorrect syntax - if the syntax was correct, it would also print 15.

   What will be printed after this code is executed?

   :feedback_a: This implementation of ``addMinutes`` does not account for values of additionMinutes that push the minute count above 60.
   :feedback_b: Implementation II works, but implementation III also works.
   :feedback_c: Implementation IV does not work for situations where additionMinutes + minutes does not go above 60.
   :feedback_d: Correct!
