    :answer_a: 3, 5
    :answer_b: True, 5
    :answer_c: 3, false
    :answer_d: True, false
    :answer_e: None of the above
    :correct: b
    :feedback_a: Incorrect! The first print statement outputs whether the x value equals 3 or not. Remember, == checks for equality and = sets a variable to a value.
    :feedback_b: Correct! The first print statment outputs whether the x value equals to 3 and the second statement prints out z, the sum of x and y. 
    :feedback_c: Incorrect! The first print statement outputs whether the x value equals 3 or not. Remember, == checks for equality and = sets a value to a variable. The second print statement outputs z, which is the sum of x and y.
    :feedback_d: Incorrect! Although it is true that the first print statement outputs whether the x value equals 3 or not, the second statement prints out z, the sum of x and y. 
    :feedback_e: Incorrect! One of the answers above is true! Remember that == checks for equality and = sets a value to a variable.

    What is the output of this code?

    .. code-block:: java

        int x = 3;
        int y = 2;
        System.out.println(x == 3);
        int z = x + y;
        System.out.println(z);

    :practice: T
    :answer_a: Deep Red (a channel)
    :answer_b: White (all channels maximum)
    :answer_c: Black (all channels minimum)
    :answer_d: 1
    :answer_e: 255
    :correct: e
    :feedback_a: Incorrect! 11111111 means 255 in binary, not Deep Red.
    :feedback_b: Incorrect! 11111111 means 255 in binary, not White.
    :feedback_c: Incorrect! 11111111 means 255 in binary, not Black.
    :feedback_d: Incorrect! 11111111 means 255 in binary. 1 in binary is 1. 
    :feedback_e: Correct! 11111111 means 255 in binary.

    What does this data stored in a computer represent?

    :practice: T
    :answer_a: Red - foo, Green - foo
    :answer_b: Red - bar, Green - bar
    :answer_c: Red - foo, Green - bar
    :answer_d: Red - bar, Green - foo
    :answer_e: None of the above
    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: Incorrect! The red box is replaced by foo, which places the space image in the background. The green box is replaced by bar, which places the image of the girl in the center, at the forefront of the image.
    :feedback_b: Incorrect! The red box is replaced by foo, which places the space image in the background. The green box is replaced by bar, which places the image of the girl in the center, at the forefront of the image.
    :feedback_c: Correct! The red box is replaced by foo, which places the space image in the background. The green box is replaced by bar, which places the image of the girl in the center, at the forefront of the image.
    :feedback_d: Incorrect! The red box is replaced by foo, which places the space image in the background. The green box is replaced by bar, which places the image of the girl in the center, at the forefront of the image.
    :feedback_e: Incorrect! One of the answers above is correct. The red box is replaced by foo, which places the space image in the background. The green box is replaced by bar, which places the image of the girl in the center, at the forefront of the image.

    What goes in the result of the red box? What goes in the result of the green box?

.. mchoice:: bs-chromakey-17-12
    :author: Beth Simon
    :practice: T
    :answer_a: Depends on the coordinates of x and y (not the color)
    :answer_b: Depends on the colors at coordinate x, y in foo
    :answer_c: Depends on the colors at coordinate x, y in bar
    :answer_d: Depends on the colors at coordinates x, y in foo compared to those in bar
    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: Incorrect! The coordinates do not indicate what part of the image you are in. The colors in bar determine what part of the image you are in. If the background color was red, the colors in bar at the x, y coordinates would determine which part of the image you are in.
    :feedback_b: Incorrect! The colors in foo do not determine what part you are in. The colors in bar determine what part of the image you are in. If the background color was red, the colors in bar at the x, y coordinates would determine which part of the image you are in.
    :feedback_c: Correct! The colors in bar determine what part of the image you are in. If the background color was red, the colors in bar at the x, y coordinates would determine which part of the image you are in.
    :feedback_d: Incorrect! The colors in foo at a certain coordinate compared to those in bar does not determine what part of the image you are in. The colors in bar determine what part of the image you are in. If the background color was red, the colors in bar at the x, y coordinates would determine which part of the image you are in.

    How will you know which part (say red) you are in?

.. mchoice:: bs-soundwaves-18-15
    :author: Beth Simon
    :practice: T
    :answer_a: Have shorter frequency and stronger compressions/rarefactions
    :answer_b: Have smaller amplitude and stronger compressions/rarefactions
    :answer_c: Have higher frequency and stronger compressions/rarefactions
    :answer_d: Have larger amplitude and stronger compressions/rarefactions
    :answer_e: None of the above
    :correct: d
    :feedback_a: Incorrect! Frequency is not impacted by feeble or loud sound. A louder sound equates to a larger amplitude and stronger compressions/rarefactions.
    :feedback_b: Incorrect! A feeble sounds has a smaller ampltitude. A louder sound equates to a larger amplitude and stronger compressions/rarefactions.
    :feedback_c: Incorrect! Frequency is not impacted by feeble or loud sound. A louder sound equates to a larger amplitude and stronger compressions/rarefactions.
    :feedback_d: Correct! A louder sound equates to a larger amplitude and stronger compressions/rarefactions.
    :feedback_e: Incorrect! One of the answers above are correct. 

    If the following sound were modified to be louder it would

    :answer_a: A
    :answer_b: B
    :answer_c: C
    :answer_d: D
    :correct: a
    :feedback_a: Correct! A higher pitch causes the frequency to increase. 
    :feedback_b: Incorrect! A higher pitch causes the frequency to increase. It does not cause the amplitude to change.
    :feedback_c: Incorrect! A higher pitch causes the frequency to increase. It does not remain the same.
    :feedback_d: Incorrect! A higher pitch causes the frequency to increase. It does not alter the shape of the sound wave.

    If the following sound were modified to have a higher pitch it would look like which of the following options:
